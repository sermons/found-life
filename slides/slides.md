For we are his **workmanship**, <br/>
created in Christ Jesus for **good works**,

which God prepared beforehand, <br/>
that we should **walk** in them.

<div class="ref">
Ephesians 2:10 (ESV)
</div>

---
Let your **light** shine before men in <br/>
such a way that they may see your **good works**, <br/>
and **glorify** your Father who is in heaven

<div class="ref">
Matthew 5:16 (NASB)
</div>

---
Never take your own **revenge**, beloved,  <br/>
but leave **room** for the wrath of God,  <br/>

for it is written,  <br/>
“**Vengeance** is Mine, I will **repay**,” says the Lord.

<div class="ref">
Romans 12:19 (NASB)
</div>

---
**Love** your enemies <br/>
and **pray** for those who persecute you, <br/>
that you may be children <br/>
of your **Father** in heaven.

He causes his **sun** to rise <br/>
on the evil and the good, <br/>
and sends **rain** <br/>
on the righteous and the unrighteous.

<div class="ref">
Matthew 5:44-45 (NASB)
</div>

---
Let every person be subject <br/>
to the governing **authorities**.

For there is no authority except **from God**,  <br/>
and those that exist <br/>
have been **instituted** by God.

<div class="ref">
Romans 13:1 (ESV)
</div>

---
Do not take an **oath** at all, <br/>
either by **heaven**, for it is the throne of God, <br/>
or by the **earth**, for it is his footstool, [...]

And do not take an oath by your **head**, <br/>
for you cannot make one hair white or black.

Let what you say be simply ‘**Yes**’ or ‘**No**’; <br/>
anything more than this comes from **evil**.

Matthew 5:34-37 (ESV)

## Outline

---
Then the Lord God said,
“It is not good for the man to be **alone**;
I will make him a **helper suitable** for him.”

For this reason a man shall
**leave** his father and his mother,
and be **joined** to his wife;
and they shall become **one flesh**.

<div class="ref">
Genesis 2:18,24 (NASB)
</div>

---
As the **church** is subject to Christ, so also <br/>
the **wives** to their husbands in everything.

Husbands, **love** your wives,  <br/>
just as **Christ** also loved the church  <br/>
and **gave** Himself up for her,  <br/>
so that He might **sanctify** her

<div class="ref">
Ephesians 5:24-26 (NASB)
</div>

---
Children, **obey** your parents in the **Lord**,
for this is **right**.

Fathers, do not **provoke** your children to anger,
but bring them up in the
**discipline** and **instruction** of the Lord.

# Q2

## Outline

---
When you **pray**, go into your **room** and shut the door <br/>
and pray to your Father who is in **secret**.

And your Father who **sees** in secret will reward you.

And when you pray, do not heap up **empty phrases** <br/>
as the Gentiles do

<div class="ref">
Matthew 6:6-7 (ESV)
</div>

---
Our **Father** in heaven, **hallowed** be your name. <br/>
Your **kingdom** come, your **will** be done, <br/>
on earth as it is in heaven.

Give us this day our **daily bread**, <br/>
and **forgive** us our debts, <br/>
as we also have forgiven our **debtors**.

And lead us not into **temptation**, <br/>
but **deliver** us from evil.

<div class="ref">
Matthew 6:9-13 (ESV)
</div>

---
Likewise the **Spirit** helps us in our **weakness**. <br/>
For we do not **know** what to pray for as we ought,

but the Spirit himself **intercedes** for us  <br/>
with **groanings** too deep for words.

Romans 8:26 (ESV)
