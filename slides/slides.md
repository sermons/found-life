For we are his **workmanship**, <br/>
created in Christ Jesus for **good works**,

which God prepared beforehand, <br/>
that we should **walk** in them.

<div class="ref">
Ephesians 2:10 (ESV)
</div>

---
Let your **light** shine before men in <br/>
such a way that they may see your **good works**, <br/>
and **glorify** your Father who is in heaven

<div class="ref">
Matthew 5:16 (NASB)
</div>

---
Never take your own **revenge**, beloved,  <br/>
but leave **room** for the wrath of God,  <br/>

for it is written,  <br/>
“**Vengeance** is Mine, I will **repay**,” says the Lord.

<div class="ref">
Romans 12:19 (NASB)
</div>

---
**Love** your enemies and **pray** for those who persecute you, <br/>
that you may be children of your **Father** in heaven.

He causes his **sun** to rise on the evil and the good, <br/>
and sends **rain** on the righteous and the unrighteous.

<div class="ref">
Matthew 5:44-45 (NASB)
</div>

---
Let every person be subject to the governing **authorities**.

For there is no authority except **from God**,  <br/>
and those that exist have been **instituted** by God.

<div class="ref">
Romans 13:1 (ESV)
</div>

---
I say to you, Do not take an **oath** at all, <br/>
either by **heaven**, for it is the throne of God, <br/>
or by the **earth**, for it is his footstool, [...]

And do not take an oath by your **head**, <br/>
for you cannot make one hair white or black.

Let what you say be simply ‘**Yes**’ or ‘**No**’; <br/>
anything more than this comes from **evil**.

Matthew 5:34-37 (ESV)
